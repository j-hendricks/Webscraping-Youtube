# Webscraping-Youtube

## Overview

Using Beatiful Soup and Splinter, the titles of Youtube videos were scraped, along with the number of views and time of posting. The videos chosen were the most recent videos posted by the top 50 most subscribed YouTube channels. The goal was to determine the most frequently used words used by the most popular channels. A word cloud was constructed to visualize this distribution.
